# Changelog

All notable changes to the `goalspec` plugin. This project follows
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). **Bump `plugins/goalspec/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
`version` on every release** — the install cache is keyed by version
(`~/.claude/plugins/cache/goal-forge/goalspec/<version>/`), so changes pushed without a
version bump are never delivered to already-installed users.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-08

### Changed
- **Renamed the plugin `goal-elaboration` → `goalspec`, and made the skill the single entry point.**
  Claude Code mandates that plugin commands are namespaced (`/plugin:command`), so the old
  `commands/goalspec.md` was only reachable as `/goal-elaboration:goalspec`. Because a skill whose
  name equals its plugin's name renders un-namespaced, naming both `goalspec` makes the skill
  invocable as a clean `/goalspec` (it also auto-triggers). The standalone command was removed and
  its runbook folded into the skill. **Install id is now `goalspec@goal-forge`** — early installers
  of `goal-elaboration@goal-forge` should `uninstall` the old id and install the new one.
- **Zero-config for any domain.** The skill no longer requires `.claude/goal.config.json`. It now
  infers everything domain-specific from the task itself: ground-truth sources (named per-task),
  files to sweep (discovered by globbing decision/TODO/pending docs), which entities to enumerate
  (the task noun), and which actions are terminal (judged per-action). Config survives only as an
  optional power-user override for pinning exact sweep files or selecting an external adversary
  backend.

### Added
- **Clarifying-questions step (anti-drift).** Before committing to a goal-spec, the agent resolves
  load-bearing ambiguity (objective / scope / terminal-action authorization / done-bar) via the
  `AskUserQuestion` modal — so a 30-second question prevents an hour of misdirected work. Balanced
  threshold; when the task is clear it states its assumptions inline instead. Degrades gracefully in
  headless/cron runs.
- **Agent-guided install instructions** in the README: a top-of-file comment for AI agents plus
  terminal-form `claude plugin` commands, team/manual/dev install paths, and uninstall.
- Plugin manifest now carries `repository`, `license`, and `keywords`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- Initial release: the 5-principle constitution + 6-question goal-spec scaffold + red-team
  (`skills/goalspec`), an independent `goal-adversary` subagent (subagent or external-CLI
  backend), the `/goalspec` command, and a fail-open, transcript-anchored Stop completion gate.
  Genericized from a validated fleet pilot; no control-plane coupling.
